# 🚗⚡ EV Smart Assistant

An **AI-powered conversational assistant** that predicts **electric vehicle (EV) range** accurately using **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI**.

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project combines data-driven ML prediction with an interactive chatbot-style interface.  
Users can input EV specs (like battery capacity, power, etc.), and the assistant predicts the **expected range in kilometers**.

---

## 🧠 Features
- 🔍 Predicts EV driving range accurately (96%+)
- 💬 Conversational interface powered by Generative AI
- 📊 Uses real EV specification dataset
- 🧰 Built entirely in Google Colab (tablet-friendly!)
